# weeker
A weekly incentive to contribute to your personal creative projects.

1. Select your cloud service (Dropbox, for instance) and social networks you allow Weeker to post to.
2. You'll have a week's time to add to a personal project of yours, and place a copy of it in Weeker's designated folder on your computer.
3. At the end the week, the work will be posted to the social networks of your choice (Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, and others). If you haven't contributed, a customizable scolding message will be posted instead!
